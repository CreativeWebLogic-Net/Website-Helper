"99","142"," <p>Welcome to Reduce Fuel Consumption,</p> <p>Fuel is expensive and because of the <a href=""http://peakoil.toho9000.com"">peak oil crisis </a> will cost even more. Our sponsers <a href=""http://www.toho9000.com"">TOHO9000 High Performance Car and Truck Engine Oil Treatment</a> have found a way to reduce your fuel consumption and increase engine power by 10%.</p><p>Regular engine oil is liquid, but as shown on the diagram, the gathering micro particles smaller than 1/100 micron are freely moving. As these microscopic particles mixed with the oxide, the carbon, or the sulfuric acid, they will grow into much bigger particles. As the particles become bigger, each particle increases in viscosity. Therefore, the particles can't go through the oil filter, causing the filter to lose its effect. Thus, the regular engine oil is not useful. Using <a href=""http://www.toho9000.com"">TOHO 9000</a>  in the regular engine oil controls the particles from growing, making it easier to go through the filter and maintaining its high performance.<br />   <br /> TOHO 900 oil particles are 3A and 5A, and that of regular engine oil 100A. The TOHO 9000 particles can penetrate deep into the internal metal parts of the engine, strongly performing its cleaning action, anti-rust protection and anticorrosion effect               </p><p align=""center""><img height=""234"" border=""0"" width=""350"" src=""http://toho9000.com/Pics/what2.jpg"" /> <img height=""227"" border=""0"" width=""250"" src=""http://toho9000.com/Pics/what3.jpg"" /></p>               <p align=""left"">When TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, ester micro particles can suppress the gathering of regular engine oil particles and the bigger particles are being surrounded by the polarity particles, stopping the bigger particles from growing. <br /></p>The dispersion/dissociation effect of TOHO 9000 will cause the oil particles diameter to be less than 1 micron. The oil filter will not be blocked even after a long usage (the size of the filter&rsquo;s pore is one micron). Since the oil particles do not stick to the filter, it can reduce oil consumption and keep the environment clean by huge reduction in waste oil disposal. If TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, oil filter&rsquo;s life span can be extended 4 to 10 times longer. Even though the sludge carbon will float in the oil as micro particles, causing the colour of the oil to turn black, this does not mean that the oil has degraded. It still remains useful.               <ul><li>                   <div align=""left""><strong>Clean the internal parts of engine</strong><br />       Keeps lubricating the internal parts of engine.<br />       Reduces wear and tear of piston ring.<br />       Lowers sludge formation behind piston rings to reduce sticking.</div>                 </li><li>                   <div align=""left""><strong>Economical</strong><br /> TOHO 9000 will not be evaporated even in high temperature.

"113","174","Australian Plumbers and Councils are now using the latest technology available to reline sewer mains with minimal disturbance to residents, businesses and the environment. &nbsp;<br /><br /><br />NuFlow Technology will send in a cleaning and camera crew to conduct an audit on sewer mains under roads and pavements to identify potential problems with town's infrastructure that require immediate attention. <br /><br />NuFlow Technology can discover where existing pipes have deteriorated to such an extent that there's not much pipe left, or it's completely worn away. <br /><br />If repair work is not undertaken, there could be significant environmental and health problems developing, especially where the pipe is the trunk sewer main transporting the bulk of the town's sewage. <br /><br />There's no disturbance to the ground surface and minimal disruption to residents, as all work is undertaken from access chamber to access chamber. Another advantage is an increase in flow rates because there is less friction on the new plastic pipe than the original sewer pipes <br /><br /><br />Great Savings for Rate Payers<br /><br />By using a relining process, you avoid digging large trenches, disturbing pathways or later undertaking rehabilitation work such as relaying turf, paths and gardens, making substantial cost savings. <br /><br />Since most of the work is underground, residents are generally unaware of such significant works occurring, and work can be undertaken while there is still flow in the sewer pipe. <a href=""http://nuflowtech.com.au/"">http://nuflowtech.com.au/</a> ","No"

Promotion and Marketing Promoting your product online is as or more important than what your site actually achieves. It can be the most informative /useful / helpful site / product in the world but if it gains no exposure, well no-one will know and use it. Integrating software / website design with the latest marketing techniques into an overall strategy is something we have a talent for. Lateral thinking is essential when competing in the global market, keeping in touch with the latest technologies and trends, such as social media, pay for performance advertising, affiliate campaigns, are just some of the techniques utilized by Creative Web Logic to achieve success locally and globally.

The advantage we have over standard web development companies is that we have Japanese locals to do our translations and customer relations. Our main office in located on the Gold Coast Queensland which has a large population of native Japanese. We can provide the highest level of service and at a price you wouldn't find natively in Japan for web development, application programming, web promotion, graphic design and search engine optimization. If you are trying to break into the English speaking market we are more professional and competitive than other Asian countries as English is our first language and we understand the nuances of the English speaking internet market. We also outsource to other companies in the IT business at very competitive rates and we are willing to build business relationships with Japanese IT companies. Our translators actively use the latest Japanese web sites, keeping them up to date on Japanese culture, trends, styles and slang. The end results of our design and development process are web sites and software that are indistinguishable from work done by a local Japanese company at a fraction of the cost. You might want a dual language website or an English website but you want to supply the content in Japanese, we can handle any situation that may arise.

Domain Name Registration
 Professional, Discount Registration. Every web site needs a domain name so go to IWebBiz Domains and register your businesses home address! We can register Australian .com.au domains as well and much cheaper than most.

Picking your domain name is very important, especially for search engine rankings. For example the website http://www.goldcoastsafetycertificates.com/ ranks great for the search term "" Gold Coast Safety Certificates"", number 1 in google actually. It is true that many domain names are already taken but many locally termed domain names aren't. For example if you were a plumber based in Benowa/Gold Coast/Queensland/Australia you could easily get the domain name www.benowaplumbing.com. This is very important because people often put the locality of there search into the text they search for.","No"

              <p align=""left"">It is so simple to use. The next time you perform and oil and oil filter change, simply add TOHO9000 to your engine oil in the ratio of 15 parts TOHO9000 to 85 parts your oil of choice. For example if your engine requires 4000mL of oil, then mix 600mL of TOHO9000 with 3,400mL of oil. </p>
              <p align=""left"">This means for most cars, 1 Litre of TOHO9000 is the perfect amount to add to your engine and still have some left over for your gearbox and differential. It couldn't be simpler.</p>

              <p align=""left"">TOHO 9000 is not a regular engine oil treatment. One regular engine oil treat usually only for one kind, but TOHO 9000 oil works on any vehicles or machines. TOHO 9000 is invested for increased high performance. More engine protection and less fuel consumption. You save oil and labour costs for heavy and light machinery, plant operation, construction plant, agricultural machinery and motor vehicles such as buses, taxi and ships. TOHO 9000 assured you of high performance at all season. It is a genuine, superb engine oil additive, It acts as anti-wear agent, viscosity improver, corrosion inhibitor and ester-diester engine lubricant TOHO WOO contains ester-diester synthetic base oil and retains viscosity at extremely high temperature for extra protection in hot summers, yet pour freely at subzero temperatures for easy starting in cold winters. TOHO 9000 resists oxidation much better than petroleum based oil and have a powerful cleaning action that dissolves and suspends sludge, varnish and carbon deposits. All these unique characteristics are not present in normal petroleum based oil.</p>
              <p align=""center""><strong>Effects and characteristics of TOHO 9000</strong></p>
              <p align=""center""><strong><img src=""https://assets.bubblecms.biz/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/what1.jpg"" width=""400"" height=""195"" align=""right""></strong></p>
              <p align=""left"">Long-term usage of oil filter<br>
  Regular engine oil is liquid, but as shown on the right hand corner, the gathering micro particles smaller than 1/100 micron are freely moving. As these micro particles mixed with the oxide, the carbon, or the sulfuric acid, they will grow into much bigger particles. As the particles become bigger, each particle increases in viscosity. Therefore, the particles cannot go through the oil filter, causing the filter to lose its effect. Thus, the regular engine oil is not useful. Using TOHO 9000 in the regular engine oil controls the particles from growing, making it easier to go through the filter and maintaining its high performance.<br>
  <br>
  TOHO 900 oil particles are 3A and 5A, and that of regular engine oil 100A. The TOHO 9000 particles can penetrate deep into the internal metal parts of the engine, strongly performing its cleaning action, anti-rust protection and anticorrosion effect</p>
              <p align=""center""><img src=""https://assets.bubblecms.biz/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/what2.jpg"" width=""350"" height=""234""> <img src=""https://assets.bubblecms.biz/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/what3.jpg"" width=""250"" height=""227""></p>
              <p align=""left"">When TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, ester micro particles can suppress the gathering of regular engine oil particles and the bigger particles are being surrounded by the polarity particles, stopping the bigger particles from growing. Thus preventing the regular engine oil from degradation. As the diagram shown above may not be clearly understood, let us explain this by giving you a simple analogy:</p>
              <p><i>.A freshly prepared glutinous cake is very sticky However, it can become less sticky by applying some flour (which is in tiny granular form imagine the bigger particles as glutinous cake and the polarity particles as tiny granular flour.</i> </p>
              <p align=""left"">The dispersion/dissociation effect of TOHO 9000 will cause the oil particles diameter to be less than 1 micron. The oil filter will not be blocked even after a long usage (the size of the filter&#146;s pore is one micron). Since the oil particles do not stick to the filter, it can reduce oil consumption and keep the environment clean by huge reduction in waste oil disposal. If TOHO 9000 is added to regular engine oil, oil filter&#146;s life span can be extended 4 to 10 times longer. Even though the sludge carbon will float in the oil as micro particles, causing the colour of the oil to turn black, this does not mean that the oil has degraded. It still remains useful.</p>

                  <div align=""left""><b>Economical</b><br>
      TOHO 9000 will not be evaporated even in high temperature. Most of the regular engine oil stick on the cylinder metal, oil is vaporized by high temperature. Replenish oil loss, the regular engine oil must be constantly added in.<br>
      TOHO 9000 does not evaporate thus reduce oil consumption. TOHO 9000 has lower than a half of its friction compared to the regular engine oil. Therefore, the engine moves smoothly without wasting oil, with increased engine horsepower, RPM and decreased exhaust temperature.</div>

              <p align=""left"">Ten years ago, most countries were not aware of the â€œgreenhouse effectâ€, and has no idea of its harmfulness or severity. But now everyone recognizes how serious and imminent this problem is.</p>
              <p align=""left"">According to information collected by the Earth Committee of the World developed countries had discharged more than 16 billion tons of carbon monoxide by 1972. However, the amount had increased to 23 billion tons by 1994. If the situation continues to develop at the same rate, then 46 billion tons of carbon monoxide will have been produced by those developed countries by 2070.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Since the establishment of our company, we have been engaged In both researches into engine oil and the conception of environmental protection.</p>
              <p align=""left"">With extensive research and latest developing technology we are able to constantly up grade TOHO 9000 products in line with our corporate philosophy: ""to reduce waste oil and emission of black smoke in order to protect our environment"".</p>

              <h1 align=""left""><a name=""E3"">Oil And The Future</a> </h1>
              <p align=""left"">Â© Richard Reese  1997 </p>
              <p align=""left"">There is a commonly held belief that the world's supply of oil will last until about 2040. A growing number of senior oil industry geologists and analysts are starting to challenge this belief publicly. They believe that it is grossly optimistic, and dangerously misleading. Their views are being published in reputable industry periodicals like World Oil, and the Oil &Gas Journal. These voices of warning are not coming from the loose cannons of the fringe. </p>
              <p align=""left"">The full version of the common myth is that (a) based on world oil reserve figures published by the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and the Oil &Gas Journal (O&GJ), and (b) at the current rate of consumption - the world oil supply will last another 40 years. This is literally true, but it is also extremely misleading. Let's take a closer look at both of the premises. </p>
              <h3 align=""left"">A. Oil Reserve Projections </h3>
              <div align=""left"">These figures include, to an uncertain degree, four types of oil supply data: (1)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Active reserves - oil that can be produced with today's technology at a profit. </li>
                    <li>Inactive reserves - oil that exists, but that can't be produced with today's technology at a profit. For example, there is oil in oil shale, but it essentially takes a barrel of oil to produce a barrel of oil. Oil shale production is only profitable because of generous government subsidies. </li>
                    <li>Political reserves - non-existent oil that is reported by government agencies for political purposes. OPEC oil production quotas are based upon the oil reserve figures provided by each member country. After this quota system was implemented in 1985, a sudden leap in world oil reserves occurred - Kuwait's reserves jumped 41%, Saudi Arabia's shot up 50%, a 100% jump in Iran, Iraq, and Venezuela, and a 200% jump in Abu Dhabi and Dubai (2) (see Figure 1). </li>
                    <li>Frozen reserves - reserve figures from active oil-producing countries that do not change from year to year. In the 1994 O&GJ report, more than half of the 94 nations listed reported the same figure as the previous year. (3) In 1996, 43 nations reported reserve figures unchanged from the year before. (4) </li>
                  </ul>
                  The following charts illustrate suspicious increases in reported reserves (Gb) from several oil producing nations. (5)
              </div>
              <p align=""left""><img src=""https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/iCWLNet-Website-Assets/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/oilch1.gif"" alt=""chart"" height=""548"" width=""533""></p>
              <p align=""left""> In short, the mainstream oil reserve numbers are useful for the purposes of theoretical geology, for documenting resource wealth as collateral for international loans, and for maintaining a comfortable OPEC production quota ceiling. But for predicting future energy supplies, they are as fishy as three-dollar bills. The numbers are certainly inflated, but no one knows exactly what the real numbers are. </p>
              <h3 align=""left"">B. Current Rates of Consumption </h3>
              <div align=""left"">The 40-year oil supply statement is based on the current rate of consumption. Unfortunately, the volume of the world's oil consumption is an ever-growing number. Note that a seemingly-modest 7% growth rate results in a doubling of consumption every ten years (world oil consumption grew at a 7% rate from 1900 to 1973). Oil consumption in the developing world is currently skyrocketing:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Taiwan's oil imports in January 1997 were up 60% over the previous year. (6) </li>
                    <li>Thailand's crude oil imports were up 36.9% in the first nine months of 1996. (7) </li>
                    <li>China's petroleum imports grew 37.5% in 1996. (8) </li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <p align=""left"">The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that, at the current rate of growth, world oil consumption will rise 50% in the next 20 years. (9) So, basing a projection upon the current rate of consumption yields a result that bears little relationship to reality. </p>
              <h2 align=""left"">The Oil Picture in a Nutshell </h2>
              <div align=""left"">Oil provides 40% of the energy in industrial countries. Oil is especially critical for agriculture, transportation, and the chemical industry. To a significant degree, oil is the engine that has driven the explosion in human population - far more oil than sun energy was used to produce your lunch. The production of food, the price of food, and the availability of food are strongly dependent on oil.
              </div>
              <p align=""left"">Humans have searched for oil for over 100 years. Until 1962, the rate at which we discovered new oil was an upward curve. But 1962 was the peak of oil discovery. Since that year, the discovery of new oil deposits has been in a steady decline. When the OPEC oil embargo of 1973 sent prices up sharply, there was a tremendous increase in exploration activities. We literally scoured the face of the Earth, looking for new oil. Even with the latest in high-tech exploration equipment, relatively little new oil was found. (10) </p>
              <p align=""left""><img src=""https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/iCWLNet-Website-Assets/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/oilch2.gif"" height=""399"" width=""560""></p>
              <p align=""left""> Although the discovery of new oil resources peaked three decades ago, the consumption of oil has continued to grow. In 1994, Petroconsultants published a report on the future of the world's oil supply. Many large oil companies provide their own data to Petroconsultants, on a confidential basis. Petroconsultants is widely regarded to be the foremost authority for the global oil industry. (11) </p>
              <p align=""left""> Based on their information, the Petroconsultants' report projected that ""world oil production will peak in 1999 at 65.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) and then decline to 52.6 mbpd in 2010."" (12) In short, the peak is coming soon, and it will be followed by a continuous and significant decline in production. </p>
              <p align=""left""> So, the projected production in 2010 is 52 mbpd. On the other hand, based on current consumption trends, the projected rate of consumption in 2010 is in the neighborhood of 94 mbpd (13) (see Figure 3). We're either going to have to find huge new deposits soon - which is essentially impossible - or we're going to see sharply rising prices, shortages, economic disruption, and so on (and this may happen suddenly). </p>
              <p align=""left""><img src=""https://f005.backblazeb2.com/file/iCWLNet-Website-Assets/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/oilch3.gif"" height=""363"" width=""502""></p>
              <p align=""left"">To make this story more interesting, there are two primary sources of oil: OPEC and non-OPEC. The OPEC countries, mostly in the Middle East, possess the bulk of the world's oil reserves. The production of the smaller non-OPEC reserves has peaked, and is in decline. Within ten years, OPEC will be the world's primary source of oil. </p>
              <p align=""left"">The Persian Gulf is the home of most of the remaining oil. Several nations in the Gulf are assumed to have nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons. The Netanyahu regime in Israel is doing anything but promoting peace in the region. In several oil-rich nations, Islamic fundamentalist resistance movements are growing in power, angered by the abuses of their non-democratic feudal monarchies. </p>
              <p align=""left"">Population growth is explosive in the Gulf, while government deficits and unemployment grow. None of the Gulf countries can grow enough food to feed itself, and all are losing land to desertification. All of them have shortages of fresh water. All of them have disputes with their neighbors over water and/or borders. (14) Long-term political stability in the Gulf is a very poor bet - and this further jeopardizes the future stability of the oil supply. The sooner stability breaks down, the sooner the final oil crisis will begin. </p>
              <p align=""left"">L. F. Ivanhoe is the president of Novum Corporation, and he has 50 years of experience in oil exploration. Here's his opinion: ""The global price of oil after 1999 should follow the simplest economic law of supply vs. demand - resulting in a major increase in crude and all other fuels' prices, with the accompanying global economic/social problems of hyper-inflation, rationing, etc. After the associated economic implosion, many of the world's developed societies may look more like today's Russia than the U.S."" (15) </p>
              <p align=""left""> Dr. Walter Youngquist, an oil industry geologist, doesn't see a bright future either. He says, ""My observations in some 70 countries over about 50 years of travel and work tell me that we are clearly already over the cliff. The momentum of population growth and resource consumption is so great that a collision course with disaster is inevitable. Large problems lie not very far ahead."" (16) </p>
              <h2 align=""left"">Alternatives to Oil </h2>
              <div align=""left"">The common knee-jerk response to predictions of an oil shortage is to grin and blurt: ""we'll just switch to another fuel supply."" It's as simple as waving the magic wand of technology. Unfortunately, current evidence doesn't seem to support the blind faith in this magic act. For transportation, the food industry, and chemical manufacturing, there are no practical replacements for petroleum. (17)
                  <ul>
                    <li>Liquid petroleum gas (LPG) is a low-volume by-product of oil refining. Thus, its supply cannot be increased. It is a non-renewable fossil resource. </li>
                    <li>Compressed natural gas (CNG) gets one-fourth the driving range per tankfull. It is also a non-renewable fossil resource. When oil prices leap, gas reserves will be quickly depleted. </li>
                    <li>Making methanol from biomass is even more expensive than making it from natural gas or unfinished gasoline. It is not a practical alternative. </li>
                    <li>Making ethanol requires more energy input than is contained in the finished end product. </li>
                    <li>Fuel cells are not currently an economically practical alternative, and they may never be. </li>
                    <li>Hydrogen technology is still decades away from being affordable, and it's starting to look like it may never be. (18) </li>
                    <li>The dreams for fusion energy are fading with each passing year. Also, the fusion process generates enormous amounts of radioactive material as a byproduct. </li>
                  </ul>
              </div>
              <p align=""left"">For the long-term future, there are three potential sources of energy: nuclear, coal, and the sun. For obvious reasons, the first two are terrible alternatives. </p>
              <p align=""left"">A solar economy requires a much smaller human population, living a much simpler lifestyle. The early 19th century supported a population of one billion, but this was based on widespread agriculture, which slowly but surely destroys the topsoil it depends on. The limit for a non-agricultural population - with a high potential for long-term sustainability - seems to be in the neighborhood of four to ten million, worldwide. </p>
              <h2 align=""left"">Summary </h2>
              <div align=""left"">The problem is not that we are going to run out of oil. The problem is that the demand for oil will soon exceed the supply of oil. The rising curve of oil consumption is expected to cross the falling curve of production some time between 2000 and 2010. (19)
              </div>
              <p align=""left""> We'll soon be in a bidding war for oil, competing against all of the other nations of the world. The costs of everything will rise. As people spend more for food, they will spend less for everything else. Thus, the global industrial consumer status quo is likely to come to an end within two to twelve years - and there will not likely be a smooth landing. </p>
              <p align=""left"">This subject opens a Pandora's box of questions about our current priorities. If you want to have children, what are they going to eat? Should you be saving for college or farmland? Could anything be more irrelevant than the skills and knowledge currently being taught in our schools and colleges? Congress has been informed about this issue (20) - why is it doing nothing? The status quo will not last forever. Now is a good time to be asking questions and re-thinking priorities. </p>

              <p align=""left"">&nbsp;</p>
              <p align=""left"">Statement</p>
              <p align=""left"">You asked me in my capacity as A lube oil chemist to make a statement on the oil additive TOHO 9000 based upon the AVL report BV 0642 of December 1996. The title of the report was &quot;Endurance Test with TOHO 9000 Oil Additive on the Liebherr D926 TI-E Engine.&quot;</p>
              <p align=""left"">In this report the effect of the oil additive TO1IO 9000 on the aging behavior of engine lube oil was tested.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The standard oil Shell Rimula TX I 5W40 WaS used for a comparison test. It is a universal engine oil with a viscosity index of 138, in the data sheet the TBN-E is indicated as 10.0 mg KOH/g and the sulphate ash as 1.2 g/1OOg., i.e. a. the oil contains both ashen additives and ash free additives.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A mixture of 85% Shell Rimula TX 10W30 and 15% TOHO 9000 was tested. The viscosity class<br>
  10W30 results from the fact that the oil containing the additive should have the same viscosity as the<br>
  standard lube oil. By adding as much as 15% TOHO 9000 this product is an extender with additive<br>
  properties.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After a endurance test of 1250 hours (MAN-Test) on a Liebherr D926 TI-% heavy-duty L-6 cylinder D.I. diesel engine the following results were observed:</p>
              <p align=""left"">The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and the smoke emission were equivalent within the measuring accuracy. The blowby of the engine (with TOHO 9000) dropped by 5-8%. Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions (measured according to the ECE R-49 Test) was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO and particles).</p>
              <p align=""left"">The 1250-hour-test was performed without any oil change. The engine was filled with 85% standard lube oil and 15% TOHO 9000. The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil where as the amount of oil taken out as sample every 50 hours was replaced with the mixture described above, i.e. standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The most essential result of the endurance test was the fact that no problems, even after 1250 hours running time, were indicated. The total base number (measured according to ASTM-D-664 or ASTM -D- 2896) is an indicator os still active additive. After 1250 hours running time the TBN of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 showed an unusually low degradation, which, moreover, appeared during the first 50 hours and thereafter virtually remained constant. Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX 10W30(SAE 10W30 + 15% TOHO 9000) resulted in an initial viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class. Then then the viscosity was stable within the SAE 10W40 class up to 1250 hours running time. Mostly, the VI-improvers contained in engine oil are degraded by shearing, which results in a viscosity decrease. The dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 was still excellent after 1250 hours engine running time. This is important because insoluble residues of combustion, e.g. soot,coke,resin and asphalt like oxidation products, have to be kept in suspension in order to prevent deposits on metal surfaces, oil thickening and sludge formation which, otherwise, can lead to corrosion. Wear metals showed a linear increase in mg metal, which indicates that TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.</p>
              <p align=""left"">In conclusion, the comparison test performed at AVL showed that the extender TOHO 9000 when used in a mixture of 85% standard lube oil and 15% TOHO 9000 in the engine described above maintains is excellent quality up to 1250 hours running time. Hence an extension of the running time to more that 1250 hours can be recommended (the natural oil consumption has to be topped up), whereas the normal cycle time of oil-changing for this test engine is 250 hours.</p>
            <p align=""left"">If the advantages of TOHO 9000 as an additive to engine lube oils, as stated in the AVL report, also prove true on a more general level, this additive will be able to extend the cycle time of oil-changing considerably and, thus, help reduce the amount of waste oil as well (environmental aspect).</p>","No"

              <p align=""left"">Dear Mr. Barroso,</p>
              <p align=""left"">we enjoy the strong opposition from OEM when additive firms are going to do their trials at our engines - without giving warranty for our customers and us.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Normally the oil-industry is developing lube oil (base-oil and additive) to prove it in quality tests like CCMC, AGFA, API or special firm tests like MB 228.5, MAN 3277 and so on.</p>
              <p align=""left"">If you chance components or add components (oil or additive) you don&#146;t really know what reaction you get. For example the anti wear additives are not able to do their work, if you have increased the anti corrosive additives.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The AVL tests are really carried out on a LIEBHERR engine - with special elements as:<br>
  bearings, gasket, cam followers and valves. We have results at following:</p>

  Based on the agreement between TOHO International Pte Ltd. and AVL dated 04-June-I 996, AVL was performing an engine durability program with the lube oil additive TOHO 9000 in order to demonstrate its long term effects on lube oil aging behavior (viscosity, TBN, Insoluble's, wear metal content etc. indicative for oil change intervals) as well as on engine performance and emissions.</p>

  This test procedure was run two and a half times accumulating a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours which is equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100.000 km.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
  An identical engine was run at LMB (LiebhelT Machines Bulle) for 500 hours with standard lube oil without any additional additive and the results will be compared to those of AVL&#146;s test with<br>
  TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The 1250 hours test at AVL was performed without an oil change whilst the regular interval for changing the engine lube oil is 250 hours according to the engine manufacturer&#146;s standards. A mixture of 85% standard lube oil (Shell Rimula TX 10W30) and 15% TOHO 9000 was used (15% TOHO is more a blending component than an additive, however we name it &#147;additive&#148;). The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil whilst the amount of oil taken out every 50 hours for the chemical analysis was replaced with the mixture.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Summary""></a><b>2. Summary and Conclusions</b><br>
  The results obtained during the subject test program are split up and summarized as follows:</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Comparison""></a><b>2.1. Comparison of the Engine Performance and Emissions with- and without TOHO 9000</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The comparison test was run at AVL before the endurance test program with the identical engine under exactly the same engine operating and similar ambient boundary conditions. Therefore, a conclusive judgment can be made:</p>
              <p align=""left""> <b>Full load performance</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and smoke emission is equivalent within the measurement accuracy.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The blowby of the engine dropped by approximately 5-8% under high speed/full load conditions, indicating some positive effect of TOHO 9000 with respect to the scaling capabilities of the piston-piston ring - cylinder liner area.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b>ECE R49 emission test</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO, particulates).</p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""Lube""></a><b>2.2. Lube Oil Analysis Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The oil analysis (TBN, viscosity, Insoluble's and wear metals) does not indicate any problems after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">TBN (ASTM-D-664 procedure) of the lube oil with 15% TOHO 9000 shows an unusually low degradation even after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Adding TOHO 9000 to a SAE 10W30 lube oil results in a viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 lube oil class and a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class oil. The viscosity was then stable within the SAE I 0W40 class up to 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Wear metals show a normal more or less linear increase in mg metal and this means TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Visual""></a><b>2.3. Visual Inspection</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">From the visual inspection of the main engine components such as engine block, cylinder liner, pistons, piston rings, valves, manifolds etc. of the engine run for 1250 hours along the MAN endurance test cycle, it can be concluded that:</p>
              <div align=""left"">
                <ul>
                  <li> The visual condition of the engine with respect to visual engine wear and the buildup of deposits is equal or better compared to the engine run without an oil change for 500 hours using a similar standard oil without TOHO.</li>
                    <li>A comparable engine run over 500 hours with the same oil and with the recommended oil change after 250 hours has been judged to be only marginally better.</li>
                    <li>None of the engine components showed irregular or abnormal wear relative to the running time accumulated on the engine</li>
                </ul>
              </div>              <p align=""left"">. </p>
              <p align=""left"">Taking into account that a standard lube oil - Shell Rimula TX 1 0W30 containing 15% of TOHO 9000 - had been used without an oil change and without changing the oil filter over 1250 hours along a quite severe test procedure, the visual condition of the engine was judged to be very good.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Further""></a><b>2.4. Further Endurance Test Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine full load performance and emissions as well as the lube oil consumption was recorded along the endurance test period in regular intervals of 250 hours.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A total amount of 63.5 liters lube oil (TX 1 0W30 w/o TOHO) had to be refilled over the running time of 1250 hours to compensate the natural lube oil consumption. This is approximately 3 times the oil filling volume of the subject engine.</p>
              <p align=""left"">None of the results indicated any abnormal engine behavior.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As no comparison data of engines of the same type run over the same running time and test cycle without TOHO are available (statistical scatter band), the obtained engine results cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 and figure as additional information only.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Conclusions""></a><b>2.5. Conclusions</b><br>
  Based on the lube oil analysis as well as on the visual inspection results of the engine main components, an extension of the running time to more than 1250 hours can be recommended.</p>
              <p align=""left"">No negative influence of the use of TOHO 9000 with respect to engine wear, power output or engine emissions arc indicated.</p>

              <p align=""left""><a name=""ComparisonTests""></a><b>3.1. Comparison Tests (Engine with and w/o TOHO)</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Before the start of the endurance test program, it was agreed to compare the engine full load and ECE R49 emission results of the Liebheii D926 TI-E engine using a standard lube oil first and then a mixture of 85% standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As standard oil Rimula TX 15W40 and 10W30 oils were used (see fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/D3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">D3</a>). Because the results just differ within the measurement accuracy, only the latter has been used for comparison. Subsequently, the oil was drained and replaced by a mixture of 85% Rimula TX 1 0W30 and 15% TOHO 9000. The engine was warmed up for approx. 15 minutes under idling conditions to assure a good mixing and after 6 hours running at various loads, the comparison full load test was performed.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As these tests have been carried out with the identical engine and the engine operating conditions (such as engine speed, boost pressure and temperature, fuel and oil temperature as well as coolant temperature etc.) were kept constant and also the ambient conditions (ambient temperature, barometric pressure) were similar, the obtained results allow conclusive judgments:<br>
  As illustrated in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/A1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Al</a>, the full load performance (maximum power output, fuel consumption, smoke emission) is equivalent within the measurement accuracy. For the ECE R49 emissions, the same good overall level of engine out emissions was observed. The individual emission components are compared in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/A2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">A2</a> and vary within the expected test-to-test variability of single test results.</p>
              <p align=""left"">It can be summarized that the use of TOHO 9000 did not influence engine performance and emission.<br>
  The self-governed low idle speed of the engine was identical.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Endurance""></a><b>3.2. Endurance Test Procedure</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine test procedure used for the project is the 500 hours MAN test cycle, as shown in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/D1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Dl</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">This procedure was run 2 &#145;/2 times so that a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours was accumulated, which correlates to approximately 100.000 km of vehicle operation.<br>

                  <br>
  Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX I 0W30 results in a viscosity increase to a SAE I 0W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 1 0W40 class.</p>
              <p align=""left"">AVL&#146;s and LicbhcIT&#146;s results of viscosity at both temperatures (40 0C/fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and 100 0C/fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a>) show this significant decrease from zero to 50 hours running time and a very small further decrease up to Ca. 400 hours running time. From 400 hours running time, a slight viscosity increase in both temperatures appears, the lube oil class is still a SAE I 0W40 class. (Note: The engine oil consumption was compensated with a SAE 10W30 lube oil without TOHO. Nevertheless, the measured viscosity was a SAE I 0W40 oil.)</p>
              <p align=""left"">A completely contrary view is seen in the Liebherr results for the I 5W/40 lube oil without TOHO, where a relatively strong increase in viscosity is seen for the whole time period up to 500 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, a viscosity decrease during the first 50 hours running time can be explained either by an oil dilution with fuel or by the shearing of high molecular compounds to lower molecular ones, but we are not familiar if TOHO 9000 contains high molecular compounds. In order to demonstrate a possible oil dilution, the boiling point distribution of samples was measured by simulated distillation in gas chromatography. No oil dilution with the fuel was detected but a depletion of TOHO 9000 or some compounds of TOHO 9000 as demonstrated in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B3</a>. On the other hand, a more or less stable viscosity increase with running time as seen with the standard Rimula TX15W/40 lube oil in figs. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a> has never been observed at AVL to date. A viscosity increase in diesel engine oils is normally seen if the insoluble content of the oil amounts to 2% and more according to AVL&#146;s experience, and this can be confirmed by the insoluble slopes in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B4.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B4</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Insoluble's were measured by infrared spectrometer (JR). By the way, the IR-spectra show a reduction of absorbence frequency at ca. 1740 cm&#146; wave number (&#151; 5.75 pm) caused by the topping up with lube oil without TOHO and/or by a degradation of compounds containing C = 0 groups. The measured peak minima are shown in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B5.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B5</a>. The C = 0 degradation became larger and larger and was no longer measurable at running times of more than 500 hours. Carbonyl (C 0) compounds are used as dispersant additives in some lube oil formulations, but may also contribute to TOHO 9000. However, as shown by the drop tests (fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B6.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B6</a>), the dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b><a name=""TBN""></a>3.3.3. TBN</b><br>
  The total base number (TBN) was measured according to ASTM-D-2896 - the perchloric acid procedure - by Liebherr and AVL as well as to ASTM-D-664 - the hydrochloric acid procedure -by AVL only. fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Normally, both methods yield the same TBN value for fresh oils, but show different diagrams<br>
  over running time (which means increasing oil aging). While TBN values measured by ASTM-D-664 decrease over running time - due to neutralization of strong acids formed during combustion<br>
  - an TBN increase measured by ASTM-D-2896 can sometimes be observed - an oxidation of<br>
  wear metals occurs by perchloiic acid.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a> shows the same TBN number of Rimula 1 5W/40 without TOHO (Licbherr ASTM-D-2896) and I 0W130 lube oil with TOHO (AVL ASTM-D-664). In case of the ASTM-D-2896 measurements of the I OW/30 lube oil with TOHO 9000. AVL and Licbhen found higher TBN numbers for the fresh oil compared to the ASTM-D-664 procedure. but both methods gave the same TBN number in fresh oils without TOHO 9000 when measured in the AVL lab.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, the ASTM-D-664 procedure shows an unusually flat TBN depletion up to around 500 hours and a relatively stable slope with further running time, but in any case, the TBN degradation is unusually low (also see fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/C13.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C13</a>) and no problems even after 1250 hours endurance testing are indicated.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <b><a name=""Wear""></a>3.3.4. Wear Metals</b><br>
  Wear metals were measured by atomic emission spectrometer in ppm per sample. When topping up, the ppm value is lowered, but the real wear must more or less show a constant increase with running time for given driving conditions. Therefore, the wear is calculated in mg out of the measured ppm value as if no lube oil is consumed by the engine and no topping up has taken place.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After an initial increase, the ppm iron for example seems to be constant by around 80 ppm after ca 500 hours running time (fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/b8.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B8</a>). Compared to this, the mg iron is approx. linearly increased with running time (fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/b9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B9</a>) and this means the real wear. The wear rates of iron up to 500 hours running time is comparable for all lube oils, therefore no advantage of TOHO 9000 was found. For copper, the ppm reading in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B10.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B10</a> and the calculated mg in fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/B11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B11</a> showed no linear increased in mg and this indicates a damage, in this case caused by an experimental bushing of the injection pump drive gear. The slopes of all other metals in mg vs. running time were found linear and do not indicate any problems (also see fig. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/C11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C11</a>).</p>

              <p align=""left"">A very linear trend of the engine wear versus the test period indicates no problem on any main engine component.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The increase of copper after about 800 running hours is due to higher wear on one experimental part of the engine fuel injection pump drive and is thus not to be correlated with the use of TOHO (also see chapter 3.3.4).</p>

Although this comparison is not scientifically correct because it is based on different engines (swept volume 3 to 12 liters) and test cycles (full load cycle, thermo shock cycle), the general trend of an unusually low degradation of TBN can be illustrated.</p>

              <p align=""left"">A dramatically increased oil consumption was observed at approximately 600 hours whilst after<br>
  750 hours the oil consumption improved continuously and at 1250 hours the level even nearly<br>
  reached the initial values again.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The reason is unknown, moreover at the same time also the engine full load smoke and fuel consumption as well as the engine R49 emission results deteriorated simultaneously and improved again later on.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As shown in figs. <a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/C14.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C14</a>,<a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/C15.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C15</a>,<a href=""https://static-assets.site/bcms/templates/toho9000/Pics/Figures/C16.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C16</a>, the natural lube oil consumption of the engine over the 1250 hours endurance test amounted to 63.5 liters, which is approximately 3 times the total oil filling volume of the engine 21.6L).</p>
              <p align=""left"">For fig. 18, showing the engine map lube oil consumption, it has to be mentioned that the measurement was, unfortunately, taken at the time of the highest lube oil consumption, but no other time window was available because of the tight schedule.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The map oil consumption was measured using AVL&#146;s oil consumption meter 403S.</p>
              <p align=""left"">In any way, the lube oil consumption results too cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 because no comparison data (statistical scatter band) of the same engine type operated without using TOHO along the same cycle and for the same running period is available.</p>

              <p align=""left"">This is to confirm that by request of TOHO International Pte Ltd. of Singapore, AVL has carried out endurance tests for 1250 with TOHO 9000 in accordance with the MAN 500 test procedure equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100,000 km. This procedure is a well known test for European engine manufacturers and has been carried out with one of the leading 10L European heavy duty engines with a rated power output of 230kW (313 PS). Based on the results of lube oil analysis (wear metal content, TBN, viscosity, insoluble's) Having been monitored throughout the whole test period, the engine with TOHO 9000 and regularly topped up with standard oil did stand for at least 100,000 km without any irregularities.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Sincerely yours,<br>

  Based on the agreement between TOHO International Pty Ltd. and AVL dated 04-June-I 996, AVL was performing an engine durability program with the lube oil additive TOHO 9000 in order to demonstrate its long term effects on lube oil aging behavior (viscosity, TBN, insoluble's, wear metal content etc. indicative for oil change intervals) as well as on engine performance and emissions.</p>

              </div>              <p align=""left"">The test procedure was the MAN 500 hours test which includes constant load phases at rated power and peak torque and intermittent load phases (low idle to rated power).<br>
  This test procedure was run two and a half times accumulating a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours which is equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100.000 km.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
  An identical engine was run at LMB (LiebhelT Machines Bulle) for 500 hours with standard lube oil without any additional additive and the results will be compared to those of AVL&#146;s test with<br>
  TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The 1250 hours test at AVL was performed without an oil change whilst the regular interval for changing the engine lube oil is 250 hours according to the engine manufacturer&#146;s standards. A mixture of 85% standard lube oil (Shell Rimula TX 10W30) and 15% TOHO 9000 was used (15% TOHO is more a blending component than an additive, however we name it &#147;additive&#148;). The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil whilst the amount of oil taken out every 50 hours for the chemical analysis was replaced with the mixture.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Summary""></a><b>2. Summary and Conclusions</b><br>
  The results obtained during the subject test program are split up and summarized as follows:</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Comparison""></a><b>2.1. Comparison of the Engine Performance and Emissions with- and without TOHO 9000</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The comparison test was run at AVL before the endurance test program with the identical engine under exactly the same engine operating and similar ambient boundary conditions. Therefore, a conclusive judgment can be made:</p>
              <p align=""left""> <b>Full load performance</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and smoke emission is equivalent within the measurement accuracy.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The blow by of the engine dropped by approximately 5-8% under high speed/full load conditions, indicating some positive effect of TOHO 9000 with respect to the scaling capabilities of the piston-piston ring - cylinder liner area.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b>ECE R49 emission test</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO, particulates).</p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""Lube""></a><b>2.2. Lube Oil Analysis Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The oil analysis (TBN, viscosity, insoluble's and wear metals) does not indicate any problems after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">TBN (ASTM-D-664 procedure) of the lube oil with 15% TOHO 9000 shows an unusually low degradation even after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Adding TOHO 9000 to a SAE 10W30 lube oil results in a viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 lube oil class and a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class oil. The viscosity was then stable within the SAE I 0W40 class up to 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Wear metals show a normal more or less linear increase in mg metal and this means TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Visual""></a><b>2.3. Visual Inspection</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">From the visual inspection of the main engine components such as engine block, cylinder liner, pistons, piston rings, valves, manifolds etc. of the engine run for 1250 hours along the MAN endurance test cycle, it can be concluded that:</p>
              <div align=""left"">
                <ul>
                  <li> The visual condition of the engine with respect to visual engine wear and the buildup of deposits is equal or better compared to the engine run without an oil change for 500 hours using a similar standard oil without TOHO.</li>
                    <li>A comparable engine run over 500 hours with the same oil and with the recommended oil change after 250 hours has been judged to be only marginally better.</li>
                    <li>None of the engine components showed irregular or abnormal wear relative to the running time accumulated on the engine</li>
                </ul>
              </div>              <p align=""left"">. </p>
              <p align=""left"">Taking into account that a standard lube oil - Shell Rimula TX 1 0W30 containing 15% of TOHO 9000 - had been used without an oil change and without changing the oil filter over 1250 hours along a quite severe test procedure, the visual condition of the engine was judged to be very good.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Further""></a><b>2.4. Further Endurance Test Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine full load performance and emissions as well as the lube oil consumption was recorded along the endurance test period in regular intervals of 250 hours.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A total amount of 63.5 liters lube oil (TX 1 0W30 w/o TOHO) had to be refilled over the running time of 1250 hours to compensate the natural lube oil consumption. This is approximately 3 times the oil filling volume of the subject engine.</p>
              <p align=""left"">None of the results indicated any abnormal engine behavior.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As no comparison data of engines of the same type run over the same running time and test cycle without TOHO are available (statistical scatter band), the obtained engine results cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 and figure as additional information only.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Conclusions""></a><b>2.5. Conclusions</b><br>
  Based on the lube oil analysis as well as on the visual inspection results of the engine main components, an extension of the running time to more than 1250 hours can be recommended.</p>
              <p align=""left"">No negative influence of the use of TOHO 9000 with respect to engine wear, power output or engine emissions arc indicated.</p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""Test""></a><b>3. Test Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""ComparisonTests""></a><b>3.1. Comparison Tests (Engine with and w/o TOHO)</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Before the start of the endurance test program, it was agreed to compare the engine full load and ECE R49 emission results of the Liebheii D926 TI-E engine using a standard lube oil first and then a mixture of 85% standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As standard oil Rimula TX 15W40 and 10W30 oils were used (see fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/D3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">D3</a>). Because the results just differ within the measurement accuracy, only the latter has been used for comparison. Subsequently, the oil was drained and replaced by a mixture of 85% Rimula TX 1 0W30 and 15% TOHO 9000. The engine was warmed up for approx. 15 minutes under idling conditions to assure a good mixing and after 6 hours running at various loads, the comparison full load test was performed.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As these tests have been carried out with the identical engine and the engine operating conditions (such as engine speed, boost pressure and temperature, fuel and oil temperature as well as coolant temperature etc.) were kept constant and also the ambient conditions (ambient temperature, barometric pressure) were similar, the obtained results allow conclusive judgments:<br>
  As illustrated in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/A1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Al</a>, the full load performance (maximum power output, fuel consumption, smoke emission) is equivalent within the measurement accuracy. For the ECE R49 emissions, the same good overall level of engine out emissions was observed. The individual emission components are compared in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/A2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">A2</a> and vary within the expected test-to-test variability of single test results.</p>
              <p align=""left"">It can be summarized that the use of TOHO 9000 did not influence engine performance and emission.<br>
  The self-governed low idle speed of the engine was identical.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Endurance""></a><b>3.2. Endurance Test Procedure</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine test procedure used for the project is the 500 hours MAN test cycle, as shown in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/D1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Dl</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">This procedure was run 2 &#145;/2 times so that a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours was accumulated, which correlates to approximately 100.000 km of vehicle operation.<br>
  Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/D2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">D2</a> gives an overview of the test sequence carried out at AVL during the subject project. The lube oil filling volume of the engine is 21.6 liters approximately.</p>

              <p align=""left"">Before starting the endurance tests, the engine was filled with Rimula I OW/30 containing 15% by weight TOHO 9000 as lube oil. After an oil sample was taken for the oil analysis, the same amount was refilled with fresh lube oil containing 15% by weight TOHO 9000, thereafter the natural engine oil consumption was topped with Rimula I OW/30 without TOHO 9000, see table 1.</p>

  Rimula TX I OW/30 + TOHO 9000 oil samples by AVL and Liebherr. Results with Rimula TX<br>

  Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX I 0W30 results in a viscosity increase to a SAE I 0W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 1 0W40 class.</p>
              <p align=""left"">AVL&#146;s and LicbhcIT&#146;s results of viscosity at both temperatures (40 0C/fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and 100 0C/fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a>) show this significant decrease from zero to 50 hours running time and a very small further decrease up to Ca. 400 hours running time. From 400 hours running time, a slight viscosity increase in both temperatures appears, the lube oil class is still a SAE I 0W40 class. (Note: The engine oil consumption was compensated with a SAE 10W30 lube oil without TOHO. Nevertheless, the measured viscosity was a SAE I 0W40 oil.)</p>
              <p align=""left"">A completely contrary view is seen in the Liebherr results for the I 5W/40 lube oil without TOHO, where a relatively strong increase in viscosity is seen for the whole time period up to 500 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, a viscosity decrease during the first 50 hours running time can be explained either by an oil dilution with fuel or by the shearing of high molecular compounds to lower molecular ones, but we are not familiar if TOHO 9000 contains high molecular compounds. In order to demonstrate a possible oil dilution, the boiling point distribution of samples was measured by simulated distillation in gas chromatography. No oil dilution with the fuel was detected but a depletion of TOHO 9000 or some compounds of TOHO 9000 as demonstrated in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B3</a>. On the other hand, a more or less stable viscosity increase with running time as seen with the standard Rimula TX15W/40 lube oil in figs. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a> has never been observed at AVL to date. A viscosity increase in diesel engine oils is normally seen if the insoluble content of the oil amounts to 2% and more according to AVL&#146;s experience, and this can be confirmed by the insoluble slopes in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B4.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B4</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The insoluble's were measured by infrared spectrometer (JR). By the way, the IR-spectra show a reduction of absorbence frequency at ca. 1740 cm&#146; wave number (&#151; 5.75 pm) caused by the topping up with lube oil without TOHO and/or by a degradation of compounds containing C = 0 groups. The measured peak minima are shown in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B5.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B5</a>. The C = 0 degradation became larger and larger and was no longer measurable at running times of more than 500 hours. Carbonyl (C 0) compounds are used as dispersant additives in some lube oil formulations, but may also contribute to TOHO 9000. However, as shown by the drop tests (fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B6.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B6</a>), the dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>

  The total base number (TBN) was measured according to ASTM-D-2896 - the perchloric acid procedure - by Liebherr and AVL as well as to ASTM-D-664 - the hydrochloric acid procedure -by AVL only. fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Normally, both methods yield the same TBN value for fresh oils, but show different diagrams<br>
  over running time (which means increasing oil aging). While TBN values measured by ASTM-D-664 decrease over running time - due to neutralization of strong acids formed during combustion<br>
  - an TBN increase measured by ASTM-D-2896 can sometimes be observed - an oxidation of<br>
  wear metals occurs by perchloiic acid.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a> shows the same TBN number of Rimula 1 5W/40 without TOHO (Licbherr ASTM-D-2896) and I 0W130 lube oil with TOHO (AVL ASTM-D-664). In case of the ASTM-D-2896 measurements of the I OW/30 lube oil with TOHO 9000. AVL and Licbhen found higher TBN numbers for the fresh oil compared to the ASTM-D-664 procedure. but both methods gave the same TBN number in fresh oils without TOHO 9000 when measured in the AVL lab.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, the ASTM-D-664 procedure shows an unusually flat TBN depletion up to around 500 hours and a relatively stable slope with further running time, but in any case, the TBN degradation is unusually low (also see fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C13.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C13</a>) and no problems even after 1250 hours endurance testing are indicated.</p>

                  <b><a name=""Wear""></a>3.3.4. Wear Metals</b><br>
  Wear metals were measured by atomic emission spectrometer in ppm per sample. When topping up, the ppm value is lowered, but the real wear must more or less show a constant increase with running time for given driving conditions. Therefore, the wear is calculated in mg out of the measured ppm value as if no lube oil is consumed by the engine and no topping up has taken place.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After an initial increase, the ppm iron for example seems to be constant by around 80 ppm after ca 500 hours running time (fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/b8.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B8</a>). Compared to this, the mg iron is approx. linearly increased with running time (fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/b9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B9</a>) and this means the real wear. The wear rates of iron up to 500 hours running time is comparable for all lube oils, therefore no advantage of TOHO 9000 was found. For copper, the ppm reading in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B10.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B10</a> and the calculated mg in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/B11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B11</a> showed no linear increased in mg and this indicates a damage, in this case caused by an experimental bushing of the injection pump drive gear. The slopes of all other metals in mg vs. running time were found linear and do not indicate any problems (also see fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C11</a>).</p>

              <p align=""left"">After the endurance test run, the engine was disassembled for a visual inspection of the main engine components. This work was done in close cooperation with the engine manufacturer to rely on his experience with engines of the same type running the same endurance test cycle.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/E1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">El</a> gives a summary of the assessment of the main engine components such as valves, intake and exhaust ports and manifolds and pistons in order to quantity~&#146; the visual impression of the buildup of carbon deposits.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine run after 1250 hours with TOHO is judged in the right column with a total of 8 points (minimum and thus best results possible is 7 points).</p>

              </div>              <p align=""left"">It can be concluded that the visual condition of the engine after 1250 running hours with TOHO concerning visual wear and buildup of deposits is equal or better compared to the engine run without an oil change for 500 hours using standard Rimula TXI 5W40 lube oil w/o TOHO.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A comparable engine run over 500 hours with the recommended oil change after 250 hours has been judged to be only marginally better.</p>

              <p align=""left"">The engine full load performance and emission status of the engine was regularly checked during the 1250 hours of the endurance test run. Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C1</a> shows the comparison of the engine full load performance before the endurance test and after 1250 hours.

              <p align=""left"">None of these results indicated any abnormal engine behavior.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As no statistically valid scatter band of results obtained on the same engine type running the same cycle and duration without using TOHO is available, the data cannot be correlated to the use of<br>
  TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Blowby versus running time</p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine blowby, the gas leaking mainly around the piston rings into the crank case is shown in figs. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C9</a> and <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C10.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C1O</a> for three different engine speeds at full load conditions.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After refilling the engine with the mixture of standard oil plus TOHO 9000, the blowby dropped by 5 to 8% within the first 6 running hours when compared to the results when using standard I 5W40 and I 0W30 lube oils.</p>
              <p align=""left"">These results indicate a positive effect of TOHO 9000 on the sealing capability of the piston ring - cylinder liner area.</p>

              <p align=""left"">The wear metals found in the lube oil show a similar trend for the endurance test engine using TOHO 9000 and the comparison engine run at LMB without TOHO as shown in fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C12.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C12</a>. In this graph the LMB-analysis results by VERNOLAB/France are cross plotted</p>
              <p align=""left"">No indication for a change of the engine wear when using TOHO 9000 was found.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A very linear trend of the engine wear versus the test period indicates no problem on any main engine component.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The increase of copper after about 800 running hours is due to higher wear on one experimental part of the engine fuel injection pump drive and is thus not to be correlated with the use of TOHO (also see chapter 3.3.4).</p>
              <p align=""left"">Comparison of TBN</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C13.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C13</a> shows the degradation of the total base number of the lube oil of the endurance test with TOHO in comparison with the usually experienced degradation of standard oils. Although this comparison is not scientifically correct because it is based on different engines (swept volume 3 to 12 liters) and test cycles (full load cycle, thermo shock cycle), the general trend of an unusually low degradation of TBN can be illustrated.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Oil consumption</p>
              <p align=""left"">The oil consumption of the engine was monitored during the whole test period and is presented in detail in figs. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C14.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C14</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C15.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C15</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C16.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C16</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C17.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C17</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C18.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C18</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
  Fig. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C17.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C17</a> shows the trend of the rated power lube oil consumption in terms of (g/h) versus the endurance test running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A dramatically increased oil consumption was observed at approximately 600 hours whilst after<br>
  750 hours the oil consumption improved continuously and at 1250 hours the level even nearly<br>
  reached the initial values again.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The reason is unknown, moreover at the same time also the engine full load smoke and fuel consumption as well as the engine R49 emission results deteriorated simultaneously and improved again later on.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As shown in figs. <a href=""../Pics/Figures/C14.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C14</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C15.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C15</a>,<a href=""../Pics/Figures/C16.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C16</a>, the natural lube oil consumption of the engine over the 1250 hours endurance test amounted to 63.5 liters, which is approximately 3 times the total oil filling volume of the engine 21.6L).</p>
              <p align=""left"">For fig. 18, showing the engine map lube oil consumption, it has to be mentioned that the measurement was, unfortunately, taken at the time of the highest lube oil consumption, but no other time window was available because of the tight schedule.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The map oil consumption was measured using AVL&#146;s oil consumption meter 403S.</p>
              <p align=""left"">In any way, the lube oil consumption results too cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 because no comparison data (statistical scatter band) of the same engine type operated without using TOHO along the same cycle and for the same running period is available.</p>

                <p align=""left"">Since the establishment of our company, we have been engaged in both research into engine oil and the conception of environmental protection. The problem caused by major transportation vehicles, heavy and light machinery and industry have been addressed in our research; since excess emission of waste gases from these sources has resulted in the greenhouse effectâ€™, which will influence the survival of mankind.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Ten years ago, most countries were not clearly aware of the greenhouse effectâ€™ and has no idea of its harmfulness or severity. But now everyone recognizes how serious and imminent this problem is.</p>
                <p align=""left"">According to information collected by the Earth Committee of the World, developed countries had discharged more than 16 billion tons of carbon monoxide by 1972. However, the amount had increased to 23 billion tons by 1994. If the situation continues to develop at the same rate, then 46 billion tons of carbon monoxide will have been produced by those developed countries by 2070.</p>
                <p align=""left"">At present, the 23 billion ton of carbon monoxide that have been emitted by the developed countries have formed â€˜greenhouse gasesâ€™ in the atmosphere, resulting in a temperature rise of one degree. The ice mountains in the South Pole have started to melt at an alarming rate. It is difficult to imagine the harm being caused by the rise of the sea level.</p>
                <p align=""left"">What adverse effects are caused when we add engine oil into engines and machines? We recognize that a lot of different engine oils on the market do not meet the needs of the consumers; even though many types of engine oils and additives have been invented to prolong engine life, reduce harmful emissions and retain quality, the benefits obtained have been very limited. Generally speaking, prolonging the life of engine oil does not make a very beneficial contribution to the reduction of pollution. In conclusion, we are still far from a satisfactory solution.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Today we have reached a turning point in promoting highly sophisticated products and developing modem technology thus obeying the slogan â€œreduce side effects, prolong the life of the engine oil and protect the environmentâ€. In the meantime, we will continue our best efforts to invent a new series of products to replace traditional oils. With a concerted research effort, the end result will be overall high quality, evident reduction of emissions, prolonged engine life, and improved productivity, with benefits for the consumers and the environment.</p>
                <p align=""left"">For the past ten years, our expert research engineers have been concentrating on a project to create a brand new kind of oil additive. After many setbacks and a great deal of hard work, we achieved a breakthrough. A first-rate oil additive has been developed and produced successfully.</p>
                <p align=""left"">This product, which has created plenty of excitement in Japanese industry, not only stands out in the market, but also brings many benefits to consumers and the environment.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Furthermore, even though the market is depressed, our new product is still in short supply and demand is high. In the meantime, we have entered and occupied international markets successfully.</p>
                <p align=""left"">All these prove that our product possesses high quality and properties which are approved by the biggest Japanese marine insurance company.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Our Team will continue to work hard with vigorous energy and with our original intention to develop new high quality product. Sharing our success with our consumers is our main objective into the future.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Finally, we want to express our extreme gratitude on behalf of our company. Thank you for your generous support.</p>

                <p align=""left"">A car runs on the energy produced when fuel is combusted in cylinders. However, not all this energy can be derived through the crankshaft. In fact, a mere 30% of the total energy is all that can be extracted. The main role of engine oil is to reduce friction, and thus reduce engine wear and tear of every part of the engine.</p>
                <p align=""left"">The oil circulation inside the engine is similar to the blood flow in the human body. Once the oil has deteriorated or oxidized, serious problems of engine productivity will develop.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Through proven experiments, normal engine oil will start to deteriorate and oxidize when the vehicle travels in excess of 1000 km. This may lead to friction damage, loss in viscosity, excess emission, reduction in the life span of the engine, and an increase in the consumption of fuel and engine oil.</p>
                <p align=""left"">After extensive research and experiment, our scientists have successfully invented a new kind of genuine, superb engine oil additive from over 90 different substances. It is able to eliminate the harmful effects to the internal parts of the engine, and reduce fuel and oil consumption drastically.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Our product is guaranteed for 120,000 km to 200,000 km when the engine is in good condition. The scale of which depends on the quality of normal engine oil used. When the engine is running, its unique characteristics of high viscosity and consists of micro-particles can penetrate deep into all parts of the engine and extremely small pores of the metal surface. The force can be applied in line with the piston movement accordingly. Strong oil film also enhances the dampen effect and thus reduce the engine noise.</p>
                <p align=""left"">It reduces the frictional resistance of the moving parts and thus reduces the wear and tear of engine. This in turn increases the internal combustion of engine (Increase in horsepower). Easy ignition of engine even at sub-zero temperature (~21oC to -45â€C) in cold winter because of its superb adhesive characteristics. Moreover, it has the properties of high level of heat resistance, acid-proof, water separation, sealing effect, anti-rust protection, cleaning effect, viscosity index (236-248), long-lasting neutralizing effect, anti-emulsifying, resulting in the reduction of the exhaust emission. Hence, the quality of the oil will not degrade over long period of time.</p>
                <p align=""left"">With all the above benefits and characteristics, TOHO 9000 should be the only genuine, superb engine oil additive of the 21st century that will save consumers time and effort in changing their engine oil.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Furthermore, our product has not only major benefits in reducing labor and material costs for heavy and light machinery, plant operation, construction plant, agricultural machinery and motor vehicles such as buses, taxis and ships; but also plays a major role in conserving natural resources, which is essential for the survival of mankind.</p>

                <p align=""left"">Since the establishment of our company, we have been engaged in both research into engine oil and the conception of environmental protection. The problem caused by major transportation vehicles, heavy and light machinery and industry have been addressed in our research; since excess emission of waste gases from these sources has resulted in the greenhouse effect&#146;, which will influence the survival of mankind.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Ten years ago, most countries were not clearly aware of the greenhouse effect&#146; and has no idea of its harmfulness or severity. But now everyone recognizes how serious and imminent this problem is.</p>
                <p align=""left"">According to information collected by the Earth Committee of the World, developed countries had discharged more than 16 billion tons of carbon monoxide by 1972. However, the amount had increased to 23 billion tons by 1994. If the situation continues to develop at the same rate, then 46 billion tons of carbon monoxide will have been produced by those developed countries by 2070.</p>
                <p align=""left"">At present, the 23 billion ton of carbon monoxide that have been emitted by the developed countries have formed &#145;greenhouse gases&#146; in the atmosphere, resulting in a temperature rise of one degree. The ice mountains in the South Pole have started to melt at an alarming rate. It is difficult to imagine the harm being caused by the rise of the sea level.</p>
                <p align=""left"">What adverse effects are caused when we add engine oil into engines and machines? We recognize that a lot of different engine oils on the market do not meet the needs of the consumers; even though many types of engine oils and additives have been invented to prolong engine life, reduce harmful emissions and retain quality, the benefits obtained have been very limited. Generally speaking, prolonging the life of engine oil does not make a very beneficial contribution to the reduction of pollution. In conclusion, we are still far from a satisfactory solution.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Today we have reached a turning point in promoting highly sophisticated products and developing modem technology thus obeying the slogan &#147;reduce side effects, prolong the life of the engine oil and protect the environment&#148;. In the meantime, we will continue our best efforts to invent a new series of products to replace traditional oils. With a concerted research effort, the end result will be overall high quality, evident reduction of emissions, prolonged engine life, and improved productivity, with benefits for the consumers and the environment.</p>
                <p align=""left"">For the past ten years, our expert research engineers have been concentrating on a project to create a brand new kind of oil additive. After many setbacks and a great deal of hard work, we achieved a breakthrough. A first-rate oil additive has been developed and produced successfully.</p>
                <p align=""left"">This product, which has created plenty of excitement in Japanese industry, not only stands out in the market, but also brings many benefits to consumers and the environment.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Furthermore, even though the market is depressed, our new product is still in short supply and demand is high. In the meantime, we have entered and occupied international markets successfully.</p>
                <p align=""left"">All these prove that our product possesses high quality and properties which are approved by the biggest Japanese marine insurance company.</p>
                <p align=""left"">Our Team will continue to work hard with vigorous energy and with our original intention to develop new high quality product. Sharing our success with our consumers is our main objective into the future.</p>

Peak oil is a term used to describe the point in time when the maximum rate of global oil production is reached, after which production will begin an irreversible decline 1. This phenomenon is related to the concept of oil depletion, which refers to the finite nature of global petroleum reserves. However, the limiting factor is not whether the oil exists but whether it can be extracted economically at a given price 1.</p>

<p>The idea of peak oil has been around for decades, and numerous predictions of the timing of peak oil have been made over the past century before being falsified by subsequent growth in the rate of petroleum extraction 1. M. King Hubbert is often credited with introducing the notion in a 1956 paper which presented a formal theory and predicted U.S. extraction to peak between 1965 and 1971 1. Hubbert’s original predictions for world peak oil production proved premature, and as of 2023, forecasts of the year of peak oil range from 2025 to 2040 1. These predictions are dependent on future economic trends, technological developments, and efforts by societies and governments to mitigate climate change 1.</p>

<p>Peak oil theory contends that conventional sources of crude oil, as of the early 21st century, either have already reached or are about to reach their maximum production capacity worldwide and will diminish significantly in volume by the middle of the century 2. However, the actual timing of peak oil is still a matter of debate among experts 3.</p>

<p>In conclusion, peak oil is a complex phenomenon that has far-reaching implications for the global economy, energy security, and the environment. While the exact timing of peak oil remains uncertain, it is clear that the world must transition to alternative sources of energy to ensure a sustainable future.</p>

<p>Peak oil has significant implications for the environment. Oil is a major source of carbon dioxide emissions, which is a driving force behind global climate change 1. Efforts to mitigate the impacts of climate change often necessitate a reduction in oil consumption 1.</p>

<p>The extraction of oil can also have negative environmental impacts. For example, oil spills can cause significant harm to marine ecosystems and wildlife 2. The process of extracting oil from the ground can also lead to soil and water pollution, habitat destruction, and other environmental problems 3.</p>

<p>In conclusion, peak oil is a complex issue that has far-reaching implications for the environment. While transitioning to alternative sources of energy is necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change, it is also important to consider the environmental impacts of oil extraction and consumption.</p>","No"

Subject : TOHO 9000 - 1250 Hours Endurance Test at AVL

Dear Mr. Lim,

This is to confirm that by request of TOHO International Pte Ltd. of Singapore, AVL has carried out endurance tests for 1250 with TOHO 9000 in accordance with the MAN 500 test procedure equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100,000 km. This procedure is a well known test for European engine manufacturers and has been carried out with one of the leading 10L European heavy duty engines with a rated power output of 230kW (313 PS). Based on the results of lube oil analysis (wear metal content, TBN, viscosity, insoluble's) Having been monitored throughout the whole test period, the engine with TOHO 9000 and regularly topped up with standard oil did stand for at least 100,000 km without any irregularities.

Sincerely yours,
AVL LIST GMBH

  Based on the agreement between TOHO International Pte Ltd. and AVL dated 04-June-I 996, AVL was performing an engine durability program with the lube oil additive TOHO 9000 in order to demonstrate its long term effects on lube oil aging behavior (viscosity, TBN, Insoluble's, wear metal content etc. indicative for oil change intervals) as well as on engine performance and emissions.</p>

              </div>              <p align=""left"">The test procedure was the MAN 500 hours test which includes constant load phases at rated power and peak torque and intermittent load phases (low idle to rated power).<br>
  This test procedure was run two and a half times accumulating a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours which is equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100.000 km.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
  An identical engine was run at LMB (LiebhelT Machines Bulle) for 500 hours with standard lube oil without any additional additive and the results will be compared to those of AVL&#146;s test with<br>
  TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The 1250 hours test at AVL was performed without an oil change whilst the regular interval for changing the engine lube oil is 250 hours according to the engine manufacturer&#146;s standards. A mixture of 85% standard lube oil (Shell Rimula TX 10W30) and 15% TOHO 9000 was used (15% TOHO is more a blending component than an additive, however we name it &#147;additive&#148;). The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil whilst the amount of oil taken out every 50 hours for the chemical analysis was replaced with the mixture.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Summary""></a><b>2. Summary and Conclusions</b><br>
  The results obtained during the subject test program are split up and summarized as follows:</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Comparison""></a><b>2.1. Comparison of the Engine Performance and Emissions with- and without TOHO 9000</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The comparison test was run at AVL before the endurance test program with the identical engine under exactly the same engine operating and similar ambient boundary conditions. Therefore, a conclusive judgment can be made:</p>
              <p align=""left""> <b>Full load performance</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and smoke emission is equivalent within the measurement accuracy.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The blowby of the engine dropped by approximately 5-8% under high speed/full load conditions, indicating some positive effect of TOHO 9000 with respect to the scaling capabilities of the piston-piston ring - cylinder liner area.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b>ECE R49 emission test</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO, particulates).</p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""Lube""></a><b>2.2. Lube Oil Analysis Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The oil analysis (TBN, viscosity, Insoluble's and wear metals) does not indicate any problems after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">TBN (ASTM-D-664 procedure) of the lube oil with 15% TOHO 9000 shows an unusually low degradation even after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Adding TOHO 9000 to a SAE 10W30 lube oil results in a viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 lube oil class and a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class oil. The viscosity was then stable within the SAE I 0W40 class up to 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Wear metals show a normal more or less linear increase in mg metal and this means TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Visual""></a><b>2.3. Visual Inspection</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">From the visual inspection of the main engine components such as engine block, cylinder liner, pistons, piston rings, valves, manifolds etc. of the engine run for 1250 hours along the MAN endurance test cycle, it can be concluded that:</p>
              <div align=""left"">
                <ul>
                  <li> The visual condition of the engine with respect to visual engine wear and the buildup of deposits is equal or better compared to the engine run without an oil change for 500 hours using a similar standard oil without TOHO.</li>

              <p align=""left"">Taking into account that a standard lube oil - Shell Rimula TX 1 0W30 containing 15% of TOHO 9000 - had been used without an oil change and without changing the oil filter over 1250 hours along a quite severe test procedure, the visual condition of the engine was judged to be very good.</p>

              <p align=""left"">The engine full load performance and emissions as well as the lube oil consumption was recorded along the endurance test period in regular intervals of 250 hours.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A total amount of 63.5 liters lube oil (TX 1 0W30 w/o TOHO) had to be refilled over the running time of 1250 hours to compensate the natural lube oil consumption. This is approximately 3 times the oil filling volume of the subject engine.</p>
              <p align=""left"">None of the results indicated any abnormal engine behavior.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As no comparison data of engines of the same type run over the same running time and test cycle without TOHO are available (statistical scatter band), the obtained engine results cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 and figure as additional information only.</p>

  Based on the lube oil analysis as well as on the visual inspection results of the engine main components, an extension of the running time to more than 1250 hours can be recommended.</p>
              <p align=""left"">No negative influence of the use of TOHO 9000 with respect to engine wear, power output or engine emissions arc indicated.</p>

              <p align=""left""><a name=""ComparisonTests""></a><b>3.1. Comparison Tests (Engine with and w/o TOHO)</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Before the start of the endurance test program, it was agreed to compare the engine full load and ECE R49 emission results of the Liebheii D926 TI-E engine using a standard lube oil first and then a mixture of 85% standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As standard oil Rimula TX 15W40 and 10W30 oils were used (see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/D3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">D3</a>). Because the results just differ within the measurement accuracy, only the latter has been used for comparison. Subsequently, the oil was drained and replaced by a mixture of 85% Rimula TX 1 0W30 and 15% TOHO 9000. The engine was warmed up for approx. 15 minutes under idling conditions to assure a good mixing and after 6 hours running at various loads, the comparison full load test was performed.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As these tests have been carried out with the identical engine and the engine operating conditions (such as engine speed, boost pressure and temperature, fuel and oil temperature as well as coolant temperature etc.) were kept constant and also the ambient conditions (ambient temperature, barometric pressure) were similar, the obtained results allow conclusive judgments:<br>
  As illustrated in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/A1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Al</a>, the full load performance (maximum power output, fuel consumption, smoke emission) is equivalent within the measurement accuracy. For the ECE R49 emissions, the same good overall level of engine out emissions was observed. The individual emission components are compared in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/A2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">A2</a> and vary within the expected test-to-test variability of single test results.</p>
              <p align=""left"">It can be summarized that the use of TOHO 9000 did not influence engine performance and emission.<br>
  The self-governed low idle speed of the engine was identical.</p>

                  <a name=""Endurance""></a><b>3.2. Endurance Test Procedure</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine test procedure used for the project is the 500 hours MAN test cycle, as shown in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/D1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Dl</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">This procedure was run 2 &#145;/2 times so that a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours was accumulated, which correlates to approximately 100.000 km of vehicle operation.<br>

              <p align=""left"">Before starting the endurance tests, the engine was filled with Rimula I OW/30 containing 15% by weight TOHO 9000 as lube oil. After an oil sample was taken for the oil analysis, the same amount was refilled with fresh lube oil containing 15% by weight TOHO 9000, thereafter the natural engine oil consumption was topped with Rimula I OW/30 without TOHO 9000, see table 1.</p>

  running time. Viscosity at 40 and 100 0C, TBN, Insoluble's and wear metals were measured with<br>
  Rimula TX I OW/30 + TOHO 9000 oil samples by AVL and Liebherr. Results with Rimula TX<br>

                  <b><a name=""Viscosity""></a>3.3.2. Viscosity, Insoluble's and Dispersant Efficiency</b><br>
                  <br>
  Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX I 0W30 results in a viscosity increase to a SAE I 0W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 1 0W40 class.</p>
              <p align=""left"">AVL&#146;s and LicbhcIT&#146;s results of viscosity at both temperatures (40 0C/fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and 100 0C/fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a>) show this significant decrease from zero to 50 hours running time and a very small further decrease up to Ca. 400 hours running time. From 400 hours running time, a slight viscosity increase in both temperatures appears, the lube oil class is still a SAE I 0W40 class. (Note: The engine oil consumption was compensated with a SAE 10W30 lube oil without TOHO. Nevertheless, the measured viscosity was a SAE I 0W40 oil.)</p>
              <p align=""left"">A completely contrary view is seen in the Liebherr results for the I 5W/40 lube oil without TOHO, where a relatively strong increase in viscosity is seen for the whole time period up to 500 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, a viscosity decrease during the first 50 hours running time can be explained either by an oil dilution with fuel or by the shearing of high molecular compounds to lower molecular ones, but we are not familiar if TOHO 9000 contains high molecular compounds. In order to demonstrate a possible oil dilution, the boiling point distribution of samples was measured by simulated distillation in gas chromatography. No oil dilution with the fuel was detected but a depletion of TOHO 9000 or some compounds of TOHO 9000 as demonstrated in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B3</a>. On the other hand, a more or less stable viscosity increase with running time as seen with the standard Rimula TX15W/40 lube oil in figs. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a> has never been observed at AVL to date. A viscosity increase in diesel engine oils is normally seen if the insoluble content of the oil amounts to 2% and more according to AVL&#146;s experience, and this can be confirmed by the insoluble slopes in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B4.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B4</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Insoluble's were measured by infrared spectrometer (JR). By the way, the IR-spectra show a reduction of absorbence frequency at ca. 1740 cm&#146; wave number (&#151; 5.75 pm) caused by the topping up with lube oil without TOHO and/or by a degradation of compounds containing C = 0 groups. The measured peak minima are shown in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B5.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B5</a>. The C = 0 degradation became larger and larger and was no longer measurable at running times of more than 500 hours. Carbonyl (C 0) compounds are used as dispersant additives in some lube oil formulations, but may also contribute to TOHO 9000. However, as shown by the drop tests (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B6.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B6</a>), the dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b><a name=""TBN""></a>3.3.3. TBN</b><br>
  The total base number (TBN) was measured according to ASTM-D-2896 - the perchloric acid procedure - by Liebherr and AVL as well as to ASTM-D-664 - the hydrochloric acid procedure -by AVL only. fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Normally, both methods yield the same TBN value for fresh oils, but show different diagrams<br>
  over running time (which means increasing oil aging). While TBN values measured by ASTM-D-664 decrease over running time - due to neutralization of strong acids formed during combustion<br>
  - an TBN increase measured by ASTM-D-2896 can sometimes be observed - an oxidation of<br>
  wear metals occurs by perchloiic acid.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a> shows the same TBN number of Rimula 1 5W/40 without TOHO (Licbherr ASTM-D-2896) and I 0W130 lube oil with TOHO (AVL ASTM-D-664). In case of the ASTM-D-2896 measurements of the I OW/30 lube oil with TOHO 9000. AVL and Licbhen found higher TBN numbers for the fresh oil compared to the ASTM-D-664 procedure. but both methods gave the same TBN number in fresh oils without TOHO 9000 when measured in the AVL lab.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, the ASTM-D-664 procedure shows an unusually flat TBN depletion up to around 500 hours and a relatively stable slope with further running time, but in any case, the TBN degradation is unusually low (also see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C13.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C13</a>) and no problems even after 1250 hours endurance testing are indicated.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <b><a name=""Wear""></a>3.3.4. Wear Metals</b><br>
  Wear metals were measured by atomic emission spectrometer in ppm per sample. When topping up, the ppm value is lowered, but the real wear must more or less show a constant increase with running time for given driving conditions. Therefore, the wear is calculated in mg out of the measured ppm value as if no lube oil is consumed by the engine and no topping up has taken place.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After an initial increase, the ppm iron for example seems to be constant by around 80 ppm after ca 500 hours running time (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/b8.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B8</a>). Compared to this, the mg iron is approx. linearly increased with running time (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/b9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B9</a>) and this means the real wear. The wear rates of iron up to 500 hours running time is comparable for all lube oils, therefore no advantage of TOHO 9000 was found. For copper, the ppm reading in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B10.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B10</a> and the calculated mg in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B11</a> showed no linear increased in mg and this indicates a damage, in this case caused by an experimental bushing of the injection pump drive gear. The slopes of all other metals in mg vs. running time were found linear and do not indicate any problems (also see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C11</a>).</p>

              <p align=""left"">The increase of copper after about 800 running hours is due to higher wear on one experimental part of the engine fuel injection pump drive and is thus not to be correlated with the use of TOHO (also see chapter 3.3.4).</p>

              <p align=""left"">A dramatically increased oil consumption was observed at approximately 600 hours whilst after<br>
  750 hours the oil consumption improved continuously and at 1250 hours the level even nearly<br>
  reached the initial values again.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The reason is unknown, moreover at the same time also the engine full load smoke and fuel consumption as well as the engine R49 emission results deteriorated simultaneously and improved again later on.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As shown in figs. <a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C14.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C14</a>,<a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C15.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C15</a>,<a href=""/web/20120311061631/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C16.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C16</a>, the natural lube oil consumption of the engine over the 1250 hours endurance test amounted to 63.5 liters, which is approximately 3 times the total oil filling volume of the engine 21.6L).</p>
              <p align=""left"">For fig. 18, showing the engine map lube oil consumption, it has to be mentioned that the measurement was, unfortunately, taken at the time of the highest lube oil consumption, but no other time window was available because of the tight schedule.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The map oil consumption was measured using AVL&#146;s oil consumption meter 403S.</p>
              <p align=""left"">In any way, the lube oil consumption results too cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 because no comparison data (statistical scatter band) of the same engine type operated without using TOHO along the same cycle and for the same running period is available.</p>

Subject: TOHO 9000 In LIEBHERR engines

Dear Mr. Barroso,

we enjoy the strong opposition from OEM when additive firms are going to do their trials at our engines - without giving warranty for our customers and us.

Normally the oil-industry is developing lube oil (base-oil and additive) to prove it in quality tests like CCMC, AGFA, API or special firm tests like MB 228.5, MAN 3277 and so on.

If you chance components or add components (oil or additive) you don’t really know what reaction you get. For example the anti wear additives are not able to do their work, if you have increased the anti corrosive additives.

The AVL tests are really carried out on a LIEBHERR engine - with special elements as:
bearings, gasket, cam followers and valves. We have results at following:

1. normal wear ratings

 
abnormal reaction in viscosity
first TOHO change viscosity rtlveau, second AVL has used
SAE IOW-30 lube oil, not 15W-40 how we have provided

3. engine cleanness was good


In any way, out of the results of only one endurance test on one engine a generally valid declaration ~s not permissible.

Extended field testing is recommended as a next step to assure long term stability and reliability criteria of the engine and the engine lube oil in real life.

with best regards

Thank you for your Telefax on 13 May 1998.
We at Airport Engineering & Service is a member of the JAL group.
Kansai plant performs maintenance of Ground Support Equipment(G S E) for Aircraft.

( Please refer Profile 1 & 2)

Secondly, We use TOHO 9000 oil in the Aircraft Tow Tractors, Cargo Loaders and Cargo tugs etc.
TOHO oil is very good performance. For example, Case of Aircraft Tow Tractor’s engine oil,
Usually. Engine oil should be replaces every 250 hr of operating hour, But replacement interval
of TOHO became every 2,500hr of operating hour. Also over haul Interval extended 125% more.

  This test procedure was run two and a half times accumulating a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours which is equivalent to a vehicle running distance of approximately 100.000 km.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
  An identical engine was run at LMB (LiebhelT Machines Bulle) for 500 hours with standard lube oil without any additional additive and the results will be compared to those of AVL&#146;s test with<br>
  TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The 1250 hours test at AVL was performed without an oil change whilst the regular interval for changing the engine lube oil is 250 hours according to the engine manufacturer&#146;s standards. A mixture of 85% standard lube oil (Shell Rimula TX 10W30) and 15% TOHO 9000 was used (15% TOHO is more a blending component than an additive, however we name it &#147;additive&#148;). The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil whilst the amount of oil taken out every 50 hours for the chemical analysis was replaced with the mixture.</p>

  The results obtained during the subject test program are split up and summarized as follows:</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Comparison""></a><b>2.1. Comparison of the Engine Performance and Emissions with- and without TOHO 9000</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The comparison test was run at AVL before the endurance test program with the identical engine under exactly the same engine operating and similar ambient boundary conditions. Therefore, a conclusive judgment can be made:</p>
              <p align=""left""> <b>Full load performance</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and smoke emission is equivalent within the measurement accuracy.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The blow by of the engine dropped by approximately 5-8% under high speed/full load conditions, indicating some positive effect of TOHO 9000 with respect to the scaling capabilities of the piston-piston ring - cylinder liner area.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b>ECE R49 emission test</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO, particulates).</p>
              <p align=""left""><a name=""Lube""></a><b>2.2. Lube Oil Analysis Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The oil analysis (TBN, viscosity, insoluble's and wear metals) does not indicate any problems after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">TBN (ASTM-D-664 procedure) of the lube oil with 15% TOHO 9000 shows an unusually low degradation even after 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Adding TOHO 9000 to a SAE 10W30 lube oil results in a viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 lube oil class and a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class oil. The viscosity was then stable within the SAE I 0W40 class up to 1250 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The Dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Wear metals show a normal more or less linear increase in mg metal and this means TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Visual""></a><b>2.3. Visual Inspection</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">From the visual inspection of the main engine components such as engine block, cylinder liner, pistons, piston rings, valves, manifolds etc. of the engine run for 1250 hours along the MAN endurance test cycle, it can be concluded that:</p>
              <div align=""left"">
                <ul>
                  <li> The visual condition of the engine with respect to visual engine wear and the buildup of deposits is equal or better compared to the engine run without an oil change for 500 hours using a similar standard oil without TOHO.</li>
                    <li>A comparable engine run over 500 hours with the same oil and with the recommended oil change after 250 hours has been judged to be only marginally better.</li>
                    <li>None of the engine components showed irregular or abnormal wear relative to the running time accumulated on the engine</li>
                </ul>
              </div>              <p align=""left"">. </p>
              <p align=""left"">Taking into account that a standard lube oil - Shell Rimula TX 1 0W30 containing 15% of TOHO 9000 - had been used without an oil change and without changing the oil filter over 1250 hours along a quite severe test procedure, the visual condition of the engine was judged to be very good.</p>

                  <a name=""Further""></a><b>2.4. Further Endurance Test Results</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">The engine full load performance and emissions as well as the lube oil consumption was recorded along the endurance test period in regular intervals of 250 hours.</p>
              <p align=""left"">A total amount of 63.5 liters lube oil (TX 1 0W30 w/o TOHO) had to be refilled over the running time of 1250 hours to compensate the natural lube oil consumption. This is approximately 3 times the oil filling volume of the subject engine.</p>
              <p align=""left"">None of the results indicated any abnormal engine behavior.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As no comparison data of engines of the same type run over the same running time and test cycle without TOHO are available (statistical scatter band), the obtained engine results cannot be correlated to the use of TOHO 9000 and figure as additional information only.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <a name=""Conclusions""></a><b>2.5. Conclusions</b><br>
  Based on the lube oil analysis as well as on the visual inspection results of the engine main components, an extension of the running time to more than 1250 hours can be recommended.</p>
              <p align=""left"">No negative influence of the use of TOHO 9000 with respect to engine wear, power output or engine emissions arc indicated.</p>

              <p align=""left""><a name=""ComparisonTests""></a><b>3.1. Comparison Tests (Engine with and w/o TOHO)</b></p>
              <p align=""left"">Before the start of the endurance test program, it was agreed to compare the engine full load and ECE R49 emission results of the Liebheii D926 TI-E engine using a standard lube oil first and then a mixture of 85% standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As standard oil Rimula TX 15W40 and 10W30 oils were used (see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/D3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">D3</a>). Because the results just differ within the measurement accuracy, only the latter has been used for comparison. Subsequently, the oil was drained and replaced by a mixture of 85% Rimula TX 1 0W30 and 15% TOHO 9000. The engine was warmed up for approx. 15 minutes under idling conditions to assure a good mixing and after 6 hours running at various loads, the comparison full load test was performed.</p>
              <p align=""left"">As these tests have been carried out with the identical engine and the engine operating conditions (such as engine speed, boost pressure and temperature, fuel and oil temperature as well as coolant temperature etc.) were kept constant and also the ambient conditions (ambient temperature, barometric pressure) were similar, the obtained results allow conclusive judgments:<br>
  As illustrated in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/A1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Al</a>, the full load performance (maximum power output, fuel consumption, smoke emission) is equivalent within the measurement accuracy. For the ECE R49 emissions, the same good overall level of engine out emissions was observed. The individual emission components are compared in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/A2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">A2</a> and vary within the expected test-to-test variability of single test results.</p>
              <p align=""left"">It can be summarized that the use of TOHO 9000 did not influence engine performance and emission.<br>
  The self-governed low idle speed of the engine was identical.</p>

              <p align=""left"">The engine test procedure used for the project is the 500 hours MAN test cycle, as shown in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/D1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">Dl</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">This procedure was run 2 &#145;/2 times so that a total endurance test running time of 1250 hours was accumulated, which correlates to approximately 100.000 km of vehicle operation.<br>

  Rimula TX I OW/30 + TOHO 9000 oil samples by AVL and Liebherr. Results with Rimula TX<br>

                  <b><a name=""Viscosity""></a>3.3.2. Viscosity, Insoluble's and Dispersant Efficiency</b><br>
                  <br>
  Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX I 0W30 results in a viscosity increase to a SAE I 0W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 1 0W40 class.</p>
              <p align=""left"">AVL&#146;s and LicbhcIT&#146;s results of viscosity at both temperatures (40 0C/fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and 100 0C/fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a>) show this significant decrease from zero to 50 hours running time and a very small further decrease up to Ca. 400 hours running time. From 400 hours running time, a slight viscosity increase in both temperatures appears, the lube oil class is still a SAE I 0W40 class. (Note: The engine oil consumption was compensated with a SAE 10W30 lube oil without TOHO. Nevertheless, the measured viscosity was a SAE I 0W40 oil.)</p>
              <p align=""left"">A completely contrary view is seen in the Liebherr results for the I 5W/40 lube oil without TOHO, where a relatively strong increase in viscosity is seen for the whole time period up to 500 hours running time.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, a viscosity decrease during the first 50 hours running time can be explained either by an oil dilution with fuel or by the shearing of high molecular compounds to lower molecular ones, but we are not familiar if TOHO 9000 contains high molecular compounds. In order to demonstrate a possible oil dilution, the boiling point distribution of samples was measured by simulated distillation in gas chromatography. No oil dilution with the fuel was detected but a depletion of TOHO 9000 or some compounds of TOHO 9000 as demonstrated in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B3.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B3</a>. On the other hand, a more or less stable viscosity increase with running time as seen with the standard Rimula TX15W/40 lube oil in figs. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B1.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B1</a> and <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B2.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B2</a> has never been observed at AVL to date. A viscosity increase in diesel engine oils is normally seen if the insoluble content of the oil amounts to 2% and more according to AVL&#146;s experience, and this can be confirmed by the insoluble slopes in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B4.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B4</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">The insoluble's were measured by infrared spectrometer (JR). By the way, the IR-spectra show a reduction of absorbence frequency at ca. 1740 cm&#146; wave number (&#151; 5.75 pm) caused by the topping up with lube oil without TOHO and/or by a degradation of compounds containing C = 0 groups. The measured peak minima are shown in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B5.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B5</a>. The C = 0 degradation became larger and larger and was no longer measurable at running times of more than 500 hours. Carbonyl (C 0) compounds are used as dispersant additives in some lube oil formulations, but may also contribute to TOHO 9000. However, as shown by the drop tests (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B6.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B6</a>), the dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 is still excellent after 1250 hrs. engine running time.</p>
              <p align=""left""><b><a name=""TBN""></a>3.3.3. TBN</b><br>
  The total base number (TBN) was measured according to ASTM-D-2896 - the perchloric acid procedure - by Liebherr and AVL as well as to ASTM-D-664 - the hydrochloric acid procedure -by AVL only. fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a>.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Normally, both methods yield the same TBN value for fresh oils, but show different diagrams<br>
  over running time (which means increasing oil aging). While TBN values measured by ASTM-D-664 decrease over running time - due to neutralization of strong acids formed during combustion<br>
  - an TBN increase measured by ASTM-D-2896 can sometimes be observed - an oxidation of<br>
  wear metals occurs by perchloiic acid.</p>
              <p align=""left"">Fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B7.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B7</a> shows the same TBN number of Rimula 1 5W/40 without TOHO (Licbherr ASTM-D-2896) and I 0W130 lube oil with TOHO (AVL ASTM-D-664). In case of the ASTM-D-2896 measurements of the I OW/30 lube oil with TOHO 9000. AVL and Licbhen found higher TBN numbers for the fresh oil compared to the ASTM-D-664 procedure. but both methods gave the same TBN number in fresh oils without TOHO 9000 when measured in the AVL lab.</p>
              <p align=""left"">However, the ASTM-D-664 procedure shows an unusually flat TBN depletion up to around 500 hours and a relatively stable slope with further running time, but in any case, the TBN degradation is unusually low (also see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C13.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C13</a>) and no problems even after 1250 hours endurance testing are indicated.</p>
              <p align=""left""><br>
                  <b><a name=""Wear""></a>3.3.4. Wear Metals</b><br>
  Wear metals were measured by atomic emission spectrometer in ppm per sample. When topping up, the ppm value is lowered, but the real wear must more or less show a constant increase with running time for given driving conditions. Therefore, the wear is calculated in mg out of the measured ppm value as if no lube oil is consumed by the engine and no topping up has taken place.</p>
              <p align=""left"">After an initial increase, the ppm iron for example seems to be constant by around 80 ppm after ca 500 hours running time (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/b8.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B8</a>). Compared to this, the mg iron is approx. linearly increased with running time (fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/b9.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B9</a>) and this means the real wear. The wear rates of iron up to 500 hours running time is comparable for all lube oils, therefore no advantage of TOHO 9000 was found. For copper, the ppm reading in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B10.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B10</a> and the calculated mg in fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/B11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">B11</a> showed no linear increased in mg and this indicates a damage, in this case caused by an experimental bushing of the injection pump drive gear. The slopes of all other metals in mg vs. running time were found linear and do not indicate any problems (also see fig. <a href=""/web/20120311084100/http://www.toho9000.com/Pics/Figures/C11.jpg"" target=""_blank"">C11</a>).</p>

Statement

You asked me in my capacity as A lube oil chemist to make a statement on the oil additive TOHO 9000 based upon the AVL report BV 0642 of December 1996. The title of the report was ""Endurance Test with TOHO 9000 Oil Additive on the Liebherr D926 TI-E Engine.""

In this report the effect of the oil additive TO1IO 9000 on the aging behavior of engine lube oil was tested.

The standard oil Shell Rimula TX I 5W40 WaS used for a comparison test. It is a universal engine oil with a viscosity index of 138, in the data sheet the TBN-E is indicated as 10.0 mg KOH/g and the sulphate ash as 1.2 g/1OOg., i.e. a. the oil contains both ashen additives and ash free additives.

A mixture of 85% Shell Rimula TX 10W30 and 15% TOHO 9000 was tested. The viscosity class
10W30 results from the fact that the oil containing the additive should have the same viscosity as the
standard lube oil. By adding as much as 15% TOHO 9000 this product is an extender with additive
properties.

After a endurance test of 1250 hours (MAN-Test) on a Liebherr D926 TI-% heavy-duty L-6 cylinder D.I. diesel engine the following results were observed:

The maximum power output, the fuel consumption and the smoke emission were equivalent within the measuring accuracy. The blowby of the engine (with TOHO 9000) dropped by 5-8%. Overall the same good level of engine-out emissions (measured according to the ECE R-49 Test) was observed for all measured emission components (NOx, HC, CO and particles).

The 1250-hour-test was performed without any oil change. The engine was filled with 85% standard lube oil and 15% TOHO 9000. The oil consumed was regularly topped up with standard lube oil where as the amount of oil taken out as sample every 50 hours was replaced with the mixture described above, i.e. standard lube oil plus 15% TOHO 9000.

The most essential result of the endurance test was the fact that no problems, even after 1250 hours running time, were indicated. The total base number (measured according to ASTM-D-664 or ASTM -D- 2896) is an indicator os still active additive. After 1250 hours running time the TBN of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 showed an unusually low degradation, which, moreover, appeared during the first 50 hours and thereafter virtually remained constant. Adding TOHO 9000 to Rimula TX 10W30(SAE 10W30 + 15% TOHO 9000) resulted in an initial viscosity increase to a SAE 10W50 class and in a drop with a short running time of 50 hours to a SAE 10W40 class. Then then the viscosity was stable within the SAE 10W40 class up to 1250 hours running time. Mostly, the VI-improvers contained in engine oil are degraded by shearing, which results in a viscosity decrease. The dispersant activity of the lube oil containing TOHO 9000 was still excellent after 1250 hours engine running time. This is important because insoluble residues of combustion, e.g. soot,coke,resin and asphalt like oxidation products, have to be kept in suspension in order to prevent deposits on metal surfaces, oil thickening and sludge formation which, otherwise, can lead to corrosion. Wear metals showed a linear increase in mg metal, which indicates that TOHO 9000 does not influence engine wear.

In conclusion, the comparison test performed at AVL showed that the extender TOHO 9000 when used in a mixture of 85% standard lube oil and 15% TOHO 9000 in the engine described above maintains is excellent quality up to 1250 hours running time. Hence an extension of the running time to more that 1250 hours can be recommended (the natural oil consumption has to be topped up), whereas the normal cycle time of oil-changing for this test engine is 250 hours.

If the advantages of TOHO 9000 as an additive to engine lube oils, as stated in the AVL report, also prove true on a more general level, this additive will be able to extend the cycle time of oil-changing considerably and, thus, help reduce the amount of waste oil as well (environmental aspect).","No"
