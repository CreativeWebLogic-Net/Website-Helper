              <p>SMSMailPro is no longer a subscription based system, it is now pay as you send. You can collect emails for months and it wont cost you a cent untill you send them a message. We also have figured out how to overcome the major problems with sms (basically we didn't know how much to charge you untill our wholesale provider got back to us and by then it could be too late).</p>
            <p>Next we want to reward you for using our system by helping others reach their intended markets. Basically you with be able to offer your contacts (without giving away their details) to other marketers in similar areas. Once you have put a price on your contacts to piggyback a message from the third party marketer into one of your own message templates. You will get paid in credits for putting their advertisement in your message. You will get paid again if your contact replies to their advertisement. The credits you are paid in goes into your usual account that you can use to send your own messages or you can cash your credits in to the house. All sectionas of the transaction are negotiable and you can approve or deny a message based on content. Your contacts can also opt-out of third party advertisements.</p>              <p>We will incorporate a response based rating system to help marketers maximize penetration and minimize cost per response to their intended markets. We will also be looking into incorporating the response rating to known measurable factors of the end user and the expected demographic for the marketer.</p></td>
